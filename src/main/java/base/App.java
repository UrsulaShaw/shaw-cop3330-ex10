Exercise 10 - Self-Checkout

Working with multiple inputs and currency can introduce some tricky precision issues.

Create a simple self-checkout system. Prompt for the prices and quantities of three items. Calculate the subtotal of the
items. Then calculate the tax using a tax rate of 5.5%. Print out the line items with the quantity and total, and then print out the subtotal, tax amount, and total.

Example Output

Enter the price of item 1: 25
Enter the quantity of item 1: 2
Enter the price of item 2: 10
Enter the quantity of item 2: 1
Enter the price of item 3: 4
Enter the quantity of item 3: 1
Subtotal: $64.00
Tax: $3.52
Total: $67.52

Constraints

Keep the input, processing, and output parts of your program separate. Collect the input, then do the math operations
and string building, and then print out the output.
Be sure you explicitly convert input to numerical data before doing any calculations.

Challenges

Revise the program to ensure that prices and quantities are entered as numeric values. Donâ€™t allow the user to proceed
if the value entered is not numeric.
Alter the program so that an indeterminate number of items can be entered. The tax and total are computed when there are
no more items to be entered.

        double subtotal = (price1 * quantity1) + (price2 * quantity2) + (price3 * quantity3);
        double tax = subtotal * taxRate;
        double total = subtotal + tax;

        System.out.printf("Subtotal: %.2f\n", subtotal);
        System.out.printf("Tax: %.2f\n", tax);
        System.out.printf("Total: %.2f", total);
